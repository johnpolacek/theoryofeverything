# Technical Addendum: The IDE-Pivot Equation

When editing Holos framework content (Logic, Predictions, content-data, Defense), keep math and citations consistent with the following.

## IDE-Pivot and Succession Operator

- **Conservation equation:** Use the IDE form
  $$\dot{\rho}_{DM} + 3H\rho_{DM}(1+\omega_{DM}) = Q_{DM}$$
- **Define** $Q_{DM}$ as the **Succession Operator**: the rate at which Dark Energy is reclaimed to fuel the growth of Ordered Dark Matter.
- The Dimensional Pivot is a measurable thermodynamic process (IDE bridge), not only a geometric shift.

## JWST COSMOS-Web (Jan 2026)

- **Citation:** arXiv:2601.17239v1.
- **Mass peaks without clear counterparts** at (RA, Dec) ≈ **(150.21, 2.06)** and **(150.32, 2.28)** in the 2026 JWST COSMOS-Web map are candidate **Succession Nodes** where the IDE energy transfer (vacuum → Ordered Dark Matter) is complete.
- **Discriminating fork:** Standard CDM predicts fuzzy, diffuse halos; JWST observes granular structure and mass-spikes more refined than standard simulations. These spikes = Ordered Nodes (no luminous counterparts).

## Physical Substrate for Bulk Migration

- Use the **axion-like particle** finding ($m \sim 10^{-13}\,\text{GeV}$) from the 2024 Metastable DE paper (arXiv:2403.04970) as the physical substrate for informational migration into the Bulk.

## DESI (2025–2026)

- Dark Energy **weakening** over time = thermodynamic signature: exhaustion of "fuel" in regions where Succession has already occurred.
- Canonical link: Quanta Magazine (DESI weakening dark energy), plus IDE models (e.g. MNRAS 511, 3076–3088, 2022).
