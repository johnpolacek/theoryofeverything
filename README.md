# Holos: A Scientific Interpretive Framework

**[whatisholos.vercel.app](https://whatisholos.vercel.app)**

We live in a universe described with extraordinary precision, yet filled with mystery. Physics tells us how matter moves, how spacetime bends, and how probabilities evolve, but *what does it mean to be real?*

Holos is an interpretive framework for understanding the nature of reality. It does not propose new physical laws or challenge establish laws of physics. Instead, it offers an explanation for how the universe described by physics becomes the universe we experience.

At its core, Holos expresses this idea as a simple relation: **R = C ⊛ O**, where reality arises from the reciprocal interplay of creation and observation.

What follows explores this idea across spacetime, infinity, life, and meaning, inviting reconsideration of some of the most fundamental questions we can ask.
