            Recent experiments—interaction-free measurements, debunked psi claims, and partial
            falsifications of objective collapse models—pose challenges to consciousness-centric
            interpretations. They suggest quantum "measurements" can occur through purely physical
            processes without requiring a conscious observer. However, Holos accommodates these
            findings by refining how observation operates, emphasizing its [ontological
            role](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology) (how it relates to existence) over a
            causal one. These experiments inform testable [predictions](/predictions) about

            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              Interaction-free measurements show information extraction without direct particle
              interaction or consciousness. Decoherence (environmental interactions suppressing
              interference) provides the physical mechanism that prepares information for
              experiential registration, but not the full "discovery."

              <strong>Holos Response:</strong> Decoherence is part of Creation (generating
              classical-like states), but Observation "registers" them experientially in the
              recursive loop. Mechanical interactions handle physical "collapse" or decoherence, but
              true manifestation requires integration into a broader experiential network—ultimately
              culminating in higher consciousness. Systems below <MathInline>{"Φ_c"}</MathInline>{" "}
