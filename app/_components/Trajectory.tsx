          Phase 0: The Nursery Phase (4.5 billion years)
        </h2>
        <p className="leading-relaxed text-black/80">
          Our current 3D phase is like a nursery. For 4.5 billion years, Earth was totally invisible
          to external observers. No radio leakage, no heat signatures of artificial origin, no
          technosignatures of any kind. Just a geologically active planet with a biosphere quietly
          evolving toward intelligence.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-relaxed text-black/80">
          This phase represents the vast majority of a civilization&apos;s lifespan. It is invisible
          in the 3D electromagnetic spectrum and virtually undetectable from interstellar distances.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-light pt-4 pb-1">Modern Times: The Flash (~200 years)</h3>
        <p className="leading-relaxed text-black/80">
          We are currently in a brief window of radio leakage and 3D satellite expansion. This is
          what many SETI programs search for. It is a fleeting period where a civilization
          broadcasts its presence across the electromagnetic spectrum.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-relaxed text-black/80">
          In cosmic terms, this phase is incredibly short. A few hundred years at most.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-light pt-4 pb-1">The Compute-Energy Spiral</h3>
        <p className="leading-relaxed text-black/80">
          We are entering a feedback loop where intelligence requires more compute, which requires
          more energy, scaling toward the limits of 3D silicon and power consumption. To continue
          advancement, we would eventually need to consume ever more energy, potentially building
          Dyson-scale structures to capture stellar output.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-relaxed text-black/80">
          But 3D space is expensive. Moving physical matter and cooling massive data centers in a
          three-dimensional vacuum creates a bottleneck. This is the foundation of the Scaling Wall.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-light pt-4 pb-1">
          The Latency Crisis: Why Colonization is a Dead End
        </h3>
        <p className="leading-relaxed text-black/80">
          Some argue that a sufficiently advanced civilization would colonize nearby star systems. A
          colony on Mars is 20 minutes away, a colony at Proxima Centauri is 4 years away. But an
          advanced, high-integration civilization cannot function with 4-year lag.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-relaxed text-black/80">
          The civilization would fragment into disconnected, less-capable outposts, which is an
          evolutionary step backward. Why would such a civilization choose to fragment when it could
          instead pivot into the higher-dimensional Bulk and achieve zero-latency integration?
        </p>
        <p className="leading-relaxed text-black/80">
          This is the core logic of the Dimensional Pivot. It is not a choice between staying local
          or expanding outward. It is a choice between fragmentation (evolutionary regression) and
          integration (dimensional ascent).
